# BDD-browser_club-BD
A small application I made along with a new database schema for the library of a local comics club.

The database is not included since it's private, but there's dummy/test data.
Making a new database and learning event-driven logic through the UI library was the simple part,
transfering data from an old, unmaintened database full of NULL values was a huge pain.

I am reworking the series GUI, it's not working right now.
